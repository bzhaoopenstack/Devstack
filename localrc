# ``HOST_IP`` should be set manually for best results if the NIC configuration
# of the host is unusual, i.e. ``eth1`` has the default route but ``eth0`` is the
# public interface.  It is auto-detected in ``stack.sh`` but often is indeterminate
# on later runs due to the IP moving from an Ethernet interface to a bridge on
# the host. Setting it here also makes it available for ``openrc`` to include
# when setting ``OS_AUTH_URL``.
# ``HOST_IP`` is not set by default.

# Logging
# -------

# By default ``stack.sh`` output only goes to the terminal where it runs.  It can
# be configured to additionally log to a file by setting ``LOGFILE`` to the full
# path of the destination log file.  A timestamp will be appended to the given name.

# Old log files are automatically removed after 7 days to keep things neat.  Change
# the number of days by setting ``LOGDAYS``.

# Nova logs will be colorized if ``SYSLOG`` is not set; turn this off by setting
# ``LOG_COLOR`` false.

# Swift
# Swift is now used as the back-end for the S3-like object store. If Nova's
# objectstore (``n-obj`` in ``ENABLED_SERVICES``) is enabled, it will NOT
# run if Swift is enabled. Setting the hash value is required and you will
# be prompted for it if Swift is enabled so just set it to something already:
#SWIFT_HASH=66a3d6b56c1f479c8b4e70ab5c2000f5
# For development purposes the default of 3 replicas is usually not required.
# Set this to 1 to save some resources:
#SWIFT_REPLICAS=1
# The data for Swift is stored by default in (``$DEST/data/swift``),
# or (``$DATA_DIR/swift``) if ``DATA_DIR`` has been set, and can be
# moved by setting ``SWIFT_DATA_DIR``. The directory will be created
# if it does not exist.
